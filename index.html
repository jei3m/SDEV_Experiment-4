                <h2 class="section-title">About me<span>.</span></h2>
                <p>I'm an aspiring Computer Engineer, and my journey into this field began at Holy Angel University, where I am currently studying. My fascination with computers has been a driving force behind my career aspirations. It all started with a simple curiosity about how computers work and the desire to build my first computer parts by parts. This initial interest not only ignited my passion for technology but also played a pivotal role in shaping my future career path.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, my personal journey spans continents. I was born in Saudi Arabia but relocated to the Philippines when I was just five years old, and I have called the Philippines my home ever since. This cultural transition has not only enriched my life experiences but has also broadened my perspective on technology, as I've had the opportunity to witness how it is embraced and integrated into different societies.</p>
                <p>As I delved deeper into the world of computer engineering, I realized that it offered endless opportunities for innovation and problem-solving. The prospect of contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies and making a meaningful impact on society truly excited me. It became evident that pursuing a career in Computer Engineering was the natural progression of my journey.</p>
                <p>Studying at Holy Angel University has provided me with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer engineering, and I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. With a strong sense of purpose and the support of my educational institution, I am confident that I will be well-prepared to embark on a successful career in Computer Engineering and make a positive difference in the world of technology.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">My Contribution<span>:</span></h2>
                <p>In our ongoing project, which focuses on the development of a tourism website, I actively contributed to various aspects of the project, particularly in the realm of web design. My role encompassed the creation of the HTML and CSS elements that form the foundation of the website's visual and interactive components. It was a multifaceted responsibility that required a blend of technical skills and creativity.</p>
                <p>One of the initial tasks I undertook was the integration of captivating images and informative content onto the website's home screen. These elements are pivotal in creating a strong first impression and enticing visitors to explore further. I carefully selected and placed images that showcased the beauty and uniqueness of the tourist destinations, while the information I added was designed to provide valuable insights and encourage user engagement.</p>
                <p>However, my involvement extended far beyond the homepage. I actively contributed to enhancing the overall User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the website. This encompassed optimizing navigation menus for intuitive use, refining the layout for aesthetic appeal, and maintaining a cohesive and visually pleasing design language throughout the site. My dedication to creating a seamless and visually appealing website experience has been central to the project's success.</p>
                <p>Collaborating on this tourism website project has been an enriching experience that has allowed me to hone my web design skills and gain a deeper understanding of the importance of aesthetics and functionality in the digital realm. I'm excited to continue contributing to the project's success and to see the final product come to life as a valuable resource for tourists and travelers.</p>
